# Real or Fake job detection
This project is based on the dataset from [Fake job prediction kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction). In this project I will try to predict the fake job postings. There are 18 columns like title, department, company profile, job description etc. I will be using NLP Techniques to analyse text data and predict as good as possible. Also I will utilize the pipeline concept to automate the train and test process. Once the training is complete the model will be saved as a pickle file to load whenever we need to predict.

There are 17880 samples in the dataset in which 17014 are real job data and 866 are fake job data. The data is biased towards real job data.

This is a overall view of the files and functions used in both the pipelines in the project. Below I have attached both train and test pipelines separately.
